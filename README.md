# who owns your work/life balance?

## You do!
And it's an important fact. In modern day "knowledge worker" life you can
always be connected to work and do work from almost anywhere. While this opens
a myriad of opportunities it also makes it a lot harder to disconnect and
recharge. Therefore working 60-80h/week is not uncommon although it burns
people out much more than the actual gains in productivity. A lot of people
have realized that and been public about maintaining a healthy balance. And
this is awesome and needs to be done more. Thus I created this site to serve
as a reminder to own your work/life balance and provide resources of articles
where people have written about this topic.
